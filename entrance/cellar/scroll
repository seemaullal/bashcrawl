# Illusions are strong here.
# It is difficult to tell what is a doorway and what is an object.
# However, the colors can give you a clue.
#
# Directories (the rooms of these catacombs) whill show up in blue.
# 
# Encounters (programs) will show up in green, red, or possibly a different color.
#
# If you don't see any colors when you run the `ls` command, try running
# the following:
# 
# alias ls='ls -G' (Mac OS)
# alias ls='ls --color' (Windows WSL)
