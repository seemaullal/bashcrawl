# Illusions are strong here.

# It is difficult to tell what is a doorway and what is an object.

# However, the colors can give you a clue.

#

# Directories (the rooms of these catacombs) whill show up in blue.

#

# Encounters (programs) will show up in green, red, or possibly a different color.

#

# If you don't see any colors when you run the `ls` command, try running

# the following:

#

# alias ls='ls -G' (Mac OS)

# alias ls='ls --color' (Windows WSL!!!!)
